The Digital Preservation Coalition supports members to deliver resilient long-term access to digital content and services. Among others they provide a forum for members to share their experiences, establish common goals, and inform their own policy development. During one of the meetings of their Web Archiving and Preservation Working Group, our research team was invited to share our knowledge about Web collections in museums and the potential of implementing PROV for describing the provenance of digital cultural heritage.
